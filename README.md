hearingAid
==========

The long term goal of this app is to be my hearing aid, cause I'm going deaf.

Step one is a hearing test of all frequencies from 20-20000 Hz, which (according to
Wikipedia) is the range of human hearing. Once all troubling frquencies are identified,
the hearing aid will amplify all of those frequencies. 

At the moment, this code is a test of OpenAL-Soft, while I learn the API.
